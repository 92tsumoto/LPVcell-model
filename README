This is a pulmonary myocardial cell model developed on the compartment structure of HuVEC model.
The CaRU of Hinch et al (2004) is used to describe the local control theory for the CICR at the dyadic junction.
The compartments were adjusted based on the Microdomain [Ca2+] near ryanodine receptors as reported by L-type Ca2+ 
and Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents: Karoly Acsai, Gudrun Antoons, Leonid Livshitz, Yoram Rudy and Karin R. Sipido. 
J Physiol. 589(10), (2011) pp.2569â€“2583.

The first version of this model was developed by Umehara in 2015-17 during his master course under the guidance of 
Prof. A Amano. The model is based on the rat experimental data published by the K.Ono group Akita (Y. Okamoto, et al., 
J Mol Cell Cardiol. 52, 988-997, 2012.)
